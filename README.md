# IngrediSearch-demo

## Corrections

- In lecture, we make `SearchViewModel` take `RecipeRepository` as constructor argument, but it's not needed.

## TODO

- Refactor test classes (Extract Superclasses for Local Unit Tests and Instrumentation Tests, respectively)
- Add loading status handling
- Add Idling resources
- Apply Event and EventObserver
- Apply caching to RecipeRepository
- Add jacoco
